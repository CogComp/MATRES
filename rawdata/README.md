Here we present more details on our MATRES dataset. In the main [readme file](https://github.com/CogComp/MATRES), we have said that we only include relations among those events that are on the main-axis. But in fact, we have performed axis assignment (i.e., step 1 in our paper) for events in the entire corpus. This information is put in this [rawdata](https://github.com/CogComp/MATRES/tree/master/rawdata) folder: `TBDense_all_new.csv` (for TimeBank-Dense), `TB_remaining_147docs.csv` (for the remaining 147 documents in TimeBank but are not in TimeBank-Dense), and `AQ_Platinum_all.csv` (for AQUAINT and Platinum). The label of the axis is in the column of "can_the_verb_span_stylecolorblueverb_span_be_anchored_in_time" and you can check the column of `bodytext` for the event.

We did also collect temporal relations on the orthogonal axis (i.e., intention or opinion), but that's only done for the 36 documents in TimeBank-Dense and you can find them in `TBDense_intersection.csv`. It's called `intersection` because for orthogonal axis, they always intersect with the main axis.

We didn't collect temporal relations on other axis because the main axis and the orthogonal axis contains roughly 90% of the events and it's very rare to see two same-axis events that are neither main nor orthogonal in one or two contiguous sentences.
