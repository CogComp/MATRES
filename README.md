This is the Multi-Axis Temporal RElations for Start-points (i.e., `MATRES`) dataset, collected via the annotation scheme proposed in

    title = {A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations},

}
```

The dataset is formatted as follows.
```
docid, verb1, verb2, eiid1, eiid2, relation
```
The `eiid`s are the same with those in TempEval3. Although in the paper above we had only annotated TimeBank-Dense (36 documents), we later extended to the entire TempEval3 dataset. According to TempEval3, the dataset is split into three parts: TimeBank, AQUAINT, and Platinum, each of which has a separate file in this repo.

A few remarks:
- MATRES is only for verb events, so those nominal events in the original TempEval3 won't appear in MATRES.
- In this repo, we only include relations among those events that are on the main-axis. Please refer to the paper for the definition of main-axis.
- For other axes and relations, please refer to this [readme file](https://github.com/qiangning/MATRES/tree/master/rawdata).
